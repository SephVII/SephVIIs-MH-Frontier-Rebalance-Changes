## SephVII´s Monster Hunter Frontier Balance Patch

★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★ __VERY IMPORTANT__ ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★

__All GRP Calculations are done with default settings means NO BOOSTS in mind if you want the Full experience of this Patch dont use any Boosts while you go through the G Rank Progression this includes "LOGIN BOOST, GRP TICKETS and certain courses like PREMIUM".__

__Dont use any of those boosts until you played through G Rank.<br>
This couldnt be done any other way otherwise it would be way of a hassle trying to include boosts and a hell of a nightmare to balance out without messing over people who dont use them.<br>
On the other Hand this is an option for people who dont care and wanna rush through use Boosts if you want to speed it up accordingly.__

## G Rank Progression The What & Why

Well if you are not aware the vanilla G Rank has no Progression at all.<br>
As soon as you reach G Rank everything will be Unlocked and you could technically go right away with anything. Your only Guideline is the Hunter Navi but even that one tells you as Introduction starting with Gurenzeburu which is 7★ the last Star Rank in G Rank. pretty weird hue ?<br>
Yep i found that the same. Well the G Rank Progression tries to tackle some if this stuff with changes we gonna go through further down below.

<br>

## Changes Are About To Happen<br>

Before you go wild here is a heads up this is definitly not the most ideal way the best would be adding Key Quests and Urgent Quests just like LR/HR, which is technical not possible at the current time and i needed to come up with an Artifical system.<br>
There was alot of things which were planed differently but sadly needed to be changed because of lack of resources to make it possible.<br>
How it is right now is the best Possible way i could come up with the current Knowledge, Tools and Possibilitys we have at the current time.<br>
If there will be better ways in the Future i will eventually change or Rework this patch accordingly.

Also this Patch Includes __Client__ and __Server__ Files to function as full experience so make sure if your not the host of the server that everyone has the same Client Files changes sicne i cant tell you what happens if not. I dont play Multiplayer and i gonna putting this in your own risk and responsibility.( Feel Pressured now ) <br>

## ------------------------ G Rank Progression Info ------------------------


  - __G Rank Progression__
  
HR5 Quest are split up into both HR5 and HR6 now.<br>
It made sense to me keeping the Pattern the compression does up since HR6 only has like 5 Monsters i found it such a waste and HR5 is very bloated with its 90ish quests stuffed together in one rank.<br>
So having :

  - HR1 + HR2 for Low Rank
  - HR3 + HR4 for High Rank
  - HR5 + HR6 for Elite Rank

before G Rank lines perfectly up and just feels better Progressive wise.<br>
Obviously there is some drawback to this and i talk about that in a moment.


## Drawbacks
  - __GR Level Requirement__
  
Settings quests to G Rank makes them automatically a "Fixed" Difficulty.<br>
For anyone who doesnt know the game has a System in G Rank which reduces your Defense by 150 for each ★ Level.<br>
This means if you have 1000 Defense you have only 850 on 2★ G Rank Quests and 700 on 3★ G Rank Quests. Normally you can adjust thos diffciulty which in return reduces the Loot including Carves you get from Monsters up to a minimum of literally nothing, also i was told that the system was never completly bugfree.<br>
Since the game throws you at 7★ G Rank quests with the Gurenzeburu introduction i doubt it has to much effect on the gameplay if you dont even know about it anyway.


  - __Material Info and Equipment__
  
The drawback for Material info being not consistent anymore and some equipment gets delayed by 1 rank.<br>
This is not a big deal at all if you just pay attention for example if it says HR4 Orange Espinas thats not True anymore because Orange Espinas is now HR3.<br>
But its not dramatic since the monsters are still in their respective Ranks so Orange Espinas is just a High Rank Monster in HR3 and HR4 so if it says HR4  or HR3 Simply means High Rank Orange Espinas. If you keep this in Mind with the Games Pattern of Ranks its very simple and easy to handle.<br>
Nonethless it is a drawback and something you need keep in mind also stuff like Equipment you usually build in HR5 maybe gets delayed by 1 rank since some HR5 monsters are now in 6 so you need to change maybe your strategys and approaches getting through those Ranks.<br>
At some point the Material Info will be fixed and adjusted properly and this will be neglactable drawback going poof.


## G Rank Progression Changes

Finally lets talk about the changes happening with this patch in more indepth.

  - __GR Level Requirement__
  
Of course the core of the Progression Change is the GR Requirements, G Rank quests are locked now behind GR Levels to emulate a sense of progression more in line with the Mainline instead of having no direction at all.<br>
From what we know the game used to have GSR as locks which is literally GR Levels but individual for each weapon Type. Obviously thats a big huge Grind lockdown to keep players playing one of the classic MMORPG grinds having GR instead of GSR is way more Dynamic and gives you better freedom to use whatever weapon you like at whenever pace on the fly.

  - __GRP Gains__
  
Another Huge Change is the GRP Gains. If you look at the vanilla state then you notice that the highest GRP per quest you can get outside of special event quests is 6000 for a Musou Hunt.<br>
That 6000 is not even 1 GR level beyond GR 31 so you probably see what a massive grind leveling was when you need to level 15 times to level 999 to have the full unlocked setup of all Weapons. This is obviously another huge MMORPG grind System left over and i changed all GRP gains on all G Rank quests.<br>
Just by Playing through the G Rank categorys you will have a good substain of GR Levels. At the End of Zenith 4 you will be around 400+.<br>
After that its a matter of grinding which is way more convient since all G Rank Quest give better GRP rates so even without boost you can reach Higher G Rank levels in a fraction of the time spend on the offical servers. And with Boost on Top of it Tremendously cut it down time wise.<br>
No more x1000 Dyuragaua kills for that Juicy 100 GR Levels, Play whatever you like in G Rank and level Organicly !

  - __G Rank Categorys Reorganization__

Another change i made is to reorganize the Questlists in G Rank, the vanilla version has around 80ish unique Monster encounters in G Rank including a G Rank exclusive Monsters in each Rank.<br>
But its badly organized the ranks are bloated up with Duplicate quests of nearly each Monster which are exactly 1:1 the same quests dont be fooled they just change the Location or Season/Time. And it maybe true that certain fights play out differenly depending on those factors but its a very lazy way to bloat up the content for G Rank.<br>
Rathian for Example has 7 duplicates for whatever reason and technically you only have like 3~6 unique Monster encounters in like 3★ G Rank and then over 10 in another one. Its very weirdly balanced. Additionally with 2.0 of this Patch i moved all Duplicate Quests into their own Category now.<br>
    
So what i did is i balanced all 7 ranks out manually with the same approach i did in LR/HR i sorted the list by Objectivly Difficulty keeping in mind how Monster Hunter introduces normally in monster games with raising difficulty from Top to Down.<br>
So each rank has now 11~13 quests needed or grinding GRP to the next rank. The last GRP quest is usually the Exclusive G rank Monster for each Rank since those feel a bit special before going to the next Rank i kept it that way.<br>
They are now the Artifical "Urgent" quests needed normally for the next rank.

  - __GR Level Tiers__

The G Rank quests are divided by GR levels in each Rank to emulate the sense of progression and unlocking more content step by step. I asked a bunch of people in the community about their opinion and let them vote what feels better to them or sounds better i simply gone with the one with the most Votes even tho theres was always a tight gap between 2 options out of the 3. So some of you might not be happy with it others will.<br>
    
Its not to hard to understand and pretty simple each Rank you have different Sets of GR Level usually around 4 different ones each of those quests give the same amount of GRP means all GR1 Quests give the same amount all GR3 give the same amount of GRP.<br>
You need to clear out the same amount of Quests present in each Tier so if you Do 4 Quests from the 4 avaible GR1 Quests you will get enough points to go to the next Tier which would be GR3 in this case. Then you do 3 Quests out of this 3 GR3 Quests and you go to the next etc etc...<br>
I Will make a Video in the Future to Explain it better and Showcase what i mean i hope this helps a bit understanding it for now.
    
How you do the quests is completly up to you the intended way is pretty much doing atleast every quests once means all 4 quests in GR1 to introduce you technically to all G rank fights and content avaible.<br>
But you obviously can choose to just do x4 Times Velocidrome or x2 Velocidrome & x2 Iodromes etc... and will just have the same effect.<br>
So if you dont like a Monster quests take another from the current GR level Tier.
    
The Duplicate quests dont give any GRP those quests are purely for Monster Material Farming so if you wanna Farm something but dont wanna mess up the GRP Progression levels you can take on those quests to get materials.<br>
Sadly tho not all quests have duplicates so some Monsters you are maybe forced for now to grind with GRP Gain example Nono Orugaron.<br>
At some later point i might can add duplicates for all of them but for now thats a Drawback we need to deal with.

  - __Permits__

Permits are the way to try to Enforce the Artifical Urgents in G Rank.<br>
Each Rank from G2 ~ G7 and Zenith have their own permit as Requirement needed to take on the quests. You will get a Bunch of Permits from the Artifical Urgents in each Rank as Sub A Reward.<br>
And then when you reach the Last GR Level Tier on the next Rank you will Unlock Permits to be Purchasable at the RoadShop in packs of x100 for 10 RdP.<br>
With 2.0 of this Patch it also Introduces HR and GR Progression Rewards the GR Progression rewards give you x100 Permits per Rank when you reached the last GR level Tier for that Corrosponding Rank in case of GR2  GR level 11 as Example.<br>

  - __Zenith Progression__

Well with all the Lists Organized Zenith is the only one i cant Maniuplate at the moment in terms of Order so the Zenith categorys for each Monster is the same but the GR Level Tiers are different obviously but i will give you a little List here how it is Organized so you can use this as Guideline.

![ZenithChart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88888479/196272801-72444275-d379-42c8-9138-b135db7c13e5.png)


  - __GRP Gain Event Quests__

The 4 GRP Event Quests which are meant for grinding GRP on retail are moved and adjusted of course to. To Reflect the GRP Changes introduced with this Patch.<br>
Also the Netcafe Requirement for the 2 Netcafe Quests were removed. Later down the line i want to edit those quests to make them more difficult and interesting for the fun and reward feeling of it instead of dull grind.

__Also i forgot to mention the Diva Defense quests are included in this questlists on the Server side, to do these quests you simply need to activate the Diva Defense Event in week 3. Just set the "DivaEvent" Value in the Erupe config.json file located in the Erupe Root folderFolder to 3 and then talk to the cat in the white robe ingame next to the Diva Defense Gal to choose a HR or GR Diva Defense Quest.__

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installation

Installation is very Simple its mostly just Drag and Drop + Replace so it should be straight forward except for the Server files. I packed the files that you just need to drop the contents of it usually in the Root Folders of the Corrosponding Path.

1. Extract the files inside the Downloaded .zip and then drag and drop the content over the corrosponding Folders. You can either Drag and Drop "Erupe" and "Monster Hunter Frontier Online" folder in the same location as their names or drag and drop the Content inside these Folders from Erupe and MHFZ into the same folders on your drive.

2. Then you will find a RoadShop.csv inside which is the Roadshop changes they can be simply Imported with Chakratos SaveManager to get the Permits in your RoadShop. This is Server side so make sure to be the Host of the server or having access to the Database. [Chakratos SaveManager](https://github.com/Chakratos/mhf-save-manager) .

3. Go to the Top of the Manager and Select the Roadshop Editor from the Server Tools. Inside of that you can simply Hit the "Import" Button and choose my RoadShop.csv and its done.<br>
This replaces your Roadshop so if you made any custom changes to the shop already its simpler to just add the Permits to your roadshop. The Fastest and easiest way would be to simply Export your current Roadshop as .csv with the SaveManager then Copy Paste the Entrys i provided in 2.0 into those files and Import them back the same way you Exported them.<br>
Same Process goes for the Distribution.csv exactly the same as Roadshop.csv just choose the Distribution manager instead on the top of the Manager.

4. If you wanna revert the changes back to the same Install Process again with the BACKUP file download.
